# Fitness Assistant Website

Created a Fitness Assistant Website named MANS, which includes a variety of features: a presentation page, main page, sign-in form, online store page, healthy food gallery, quiz, leaderboard, about us section, newsletter signup, feedback form and editor's page.

In this project, my role involved designing the leaderboard page , the newsletter signup form and my editor's page. I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML to develop these components. The result is a comprehensive website that offers a range of functionalities to enhance the user experience.

In order to access the webpage, please download the repository as a zip folder.
