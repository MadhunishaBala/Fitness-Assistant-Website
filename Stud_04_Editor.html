  <p>Welcome to <em>MANS</em>.I am Madhunisha Balajeyandhan, I am 18 years old.
    I schooled at Royal Institute and completed my high school studies in 2022. I am currently doing
    my degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the Informatics Institute of Technology which is affiliated with 
    Robert Gordon University is situated in the UK. This website is created by my friends and me for our Web Technology CourseWork, which
    is regarding <i>Fitness and Health</i>. Here's a small flashback of my fitness story!

    Fitness was never my thing, when I was in my early teens I used to intake food based on my likes,
    which most of the time is to be junk and a very less intake of vegetables. The quantity of this intake used to be 
    very large, I remember I just keep on eating even though I don't feel hungry cause I loved the junk.
    As you expect,<b>YES</b> I put up so much weight. Well, the realization didn't hit till I went shopping one day and
    found out that I no more fit the size Large and have to move to size XL. I wouldn't say I was insecure,
    but I didn't the adjective "fat" to be used to define me. But, trust me, I took no action, I instead changed my
    mentality and said to myself "being healthy is important".

     It was during the pandemic when I was at home, I started an exercise routine to keep myself from being lazy.
      Though the exercise routine was not done daily, I felt very energetic and flexible with this.
      I also started to cut down on sugars and increase the intake of proteins and vegetables, I finally started to follow
      the food pyramid I learned in Grade 3. Fast-forward to today, I have reduced so much weight
      and also am very healthy than I was back then.
