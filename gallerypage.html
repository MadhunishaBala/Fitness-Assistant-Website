The process is quicker and can be more energy-efficient than using the oven.Scrub the potatoes, then pat dry with kitchen paper. Transfer to a plate, drizzle over the oil and rub it into the skins using your hands so the potatoes are well-coated. Season with salt and pepper – the salt will help the skins crisp up.Arrange the potatoes in a single layer in an air fryer basket. Set the air fryer to 200C and cook for 40-50 mins, or until a sharp knife goes through the potatoes easily. Check the potatoes after 20 mins – if they seem to be browning too quickly on one side, turn them over using tongs, then check again after another 20 mins to ensure they are cooked through. When ready, the skin should be crisp and the inside tender and fluffy. Split and serve immediately with the toppings of your choice.')">
